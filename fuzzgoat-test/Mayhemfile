# Mayhemfile: configuration file for testing your target with Mayhem
# Format: YAML 1.1

# Mayhemfile version specifier
version: '1.13'

# Namespaced project name that the target belongs to
project: abrewer/fuzzgoat

# Target name (should be unique within the project)
target: fuzzgoat

# Base image to run the binary in.
# baseimage: $MAYHEM_DOCKER_REGISTRY/forallsecure/debian-buster:latest

duration: 300

# Turns on extra test case processing (completing a run will take longer)
advanced_triage: false

# Configure tasks to be run. If null or missing, defaults to exploitability factors, regression testing, and behavior testing.
tasks:
  - name: exploitability_factors
  - name: regression_testing
  - name: behavior_testing

# List of commands used to test the target
cmds:

  # Command used to start the target, "@@" is the input file
  # (when "@@" is omitted Mayhem defaults to stdin inputs)
  - cmd: /home/abrewer/mayhem/fuzzgoat/fuzzgoat @@
    env: {}

    ## Uncomment to change default dir (/) from which the target is invoked
    #chdir: /

    ## If this is a network target, uncomment the block below and remove
    ## the @@ input file reference in the cmd (you can either test network or
    ## file inputs, not both).
    #network:
    ## Use "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" below if you want to test only
    ## for IPv4. For IPv6, use "[::1]". By leaving as "localhost", Mayhem will
    ## attempt to autodetect the one used by the target.
    #  url: tcp://localhost:8080  # protocol, host and port to analyze
    #  is_client: false           # target is a client-side program
    #  timeout: 2.0               # max seconds for sending data

    ## Max test case length (in bytes) to be taken into account. Test cases over
    ## that length will be truncated. Be very careful about increasing this
    ## limit as it can severely affect your fuzzer performance.
